# Visualizing the Nepal Earthquake

## Design Goals
Our goal for this project is to create a data journalism piece to inform, engage, and educate users about the 2015 Nepal Earthquake and the associated (and still ongoing) rebuilding process. Our intended audience isn't necessarily data scientists or international development experts, instead we aim to reach the members of the general public who may be broadly familiar with the disaster in Nepal but unaware of most of the details.

For this reason, we've chosen a mix of interactive visualizations of quantitative data and first-person narrative accounts and photos. This approach enables us to depict broad trends, but without sacrificing the personal stories from the affected communities.
